# Roblox is no longer supported on Wine.
Consider using Waydroid & install the Android version of Roblox.

# Welcome!

## Questions and Answers

* Q: How do I install this?
  * A: See the Installation Wiki.

* Q: It tells me there is a syntax error, or I'm having another problem.
  * A: Download the script again and retry. If the same thing occurs, [open a new issue here](https://github.com/roblox-linux-wrapper/roblox-linux-wrapper/issues).

* Q: Roblox isn't behaving like it should.
  * A: Select the "Reinstall Roblox" option and press "Ok". If you continue having problems, [file a bug report here](https://github.com/roblox-linux-wrapper/roblox-linux-wrapper/issues).

  * A: This is the old method used to launch games. Paste the game link in and click "Play" to launch the game.

* Q: It keeps telling me "Missing Dependencies"!
  * A: Then install it! If it tells you "Please install wine", then install Wine. It does not install these dependencies automatically. To install the latest version of Wine, visit https://www.winehq.org/download/.
